# ServerSignsCommandConverter
This plugin will convert all sign commands in the plugin ServerSigns to a new command. For an example, if you are using GroupManager and want to convert to LuckPerms, you might not want to cause of your 500 or so signs with permission commands. This plugin allows you to quickly convert all the commands.

# Building
I used the default builder in IntelliJ IDEA to build this. To build this yourself, you'll need to download ServerSigns: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/serversigns and add it to your Library/Resources.
